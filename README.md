## About This App

This app was built with React.JS and it uses an Express / Node.JS app as its server

An user can create an account and create tasks that they can track from anywhere if they have internet access.\
The tasks user create are categorized by time and its priority.\
The tasks are archived automatically if it's past one week of its specified time and deleted after two. ( This approach was taken to reduce the burden on the server and the database )

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies that it needs to run.

### `npm start`

Runs the application on a development or cloud server.
